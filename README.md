## About the Project

This is a member's-only project using Ruby on Rails.  This project is a building of an exclusive clubhouse where your members can write anonymous posts. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

Devise is a flexible authentication solution for Rails based on Warden. It:

- Is Rack based;
- Is a complete MVC solution based on Rails engines;
- Allows you to have multiple models signed in at the same time;
- Is based on a modularity concept: use only what you really need.
